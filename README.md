# Control Structures in Python â€“ Assignment 2

This repository includes Python scripts demonstrating basic control structures like conditional statements and loops.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
- Displays the result accordingly.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Calculates the sum of all integers in the range.
- Prints the final sum.

## How to Run
Make sure Python is installed. Run the scripts using:

```bash
python task1_even_odd.py
python task2_sum_loop.py
```

## Files Included
- `task1_even_odd.py`
- `task2_sum_loop.py`
