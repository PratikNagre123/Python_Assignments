# File Handling in Python â€“ Assignment 4

This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate file handling operations, including reading, writing, and error handling.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Tries to open and read a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints the file content line by line.
- Gracefully handles errors if the file does not exist.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends additional data to the same file.
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.

## How to Run
Ensure Python is installed. Run the scripts using:

```bash
python task1_read_file.py
python task2_write_append_file.py
```

## Files Included
- `task1_read_file.py`
- `task2_write_append_file.py`
